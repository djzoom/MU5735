## Overview

This project reconstructs the flight trajectory of MU5735 (B-1791, Boeing 737-89P) on March 21, 2022, route KMG→CAN, using publicly available ADS-B and FDR data. The visualization covers the final 2 minutes and 13 seconds — from cruise at FL291 through the two-phase descent to impact at Teng County, Guangxi.

All data comes from publicly disclosed open sources. No classified or restricted information is used.

本重建所使用的全部数据均来自网上公开披露的开源信息，未使用任何保密或受限数据。

### 2. FDR Disclosed Data 飞行数据记录器已披露数据

Data from the last ~90 seconds of FDR recording before power loss at ~26,000 ft.

| Time (CST) | Event | Source |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| 14:20:38 | Engine 1 & 2 fuel switches RUN→CUTOFF (simultaneous) | FDR Fig 11 |
| 14:20:41 | AP-1/AP-2 Warn ON (~3s after cutoff) | FDR Fig 11 |
| 14:20:44 | Last stable flight parameters at FL291 | FDR Fig 11 |
| 14:20:45 | Roll passes −90° (left wing fully down) | FDR Fig 13 |
| 14:20:49 | Inverted — roll −180° / +180° wrap | FDR Fig 13 |
| 14:20:58 | Roll −270° cumulative (right wing fully down) | FDR Fig 13 |
| 14:21:01 | FDR power loss — engine N2 below generator threshold | FDR Fig 11 |

#### 2.1 FDR-traced attitude (NTSB Fig 11 / Fig 13) — MEASURED

Pitch and Roll for the FDR-traced 21-second window (T = engine cutoff 14:20:38 CST → 14:20:59 CST; the FDR recording itself extends ~2 s further to power loss at 14:21:01) are traced **directly** from NTSB DCA22WA102 plots, not estimated:

| Parameter | Source plot | Profile traced from plot |
|-----------|-------------|--------------------------|
| Pitch     | Fig 11 — Pitch Angle | Holds 0° to T+5s, smoothstep monotonic to −35° at T+21s (no oscillation) |
| Roll      | Fig 13 — Roll Angle (zoomed) | Holds 0° to T+3s (AP active until disconnect), then continuous unidirectional left rotation: 0° → −180° at T+11s (8s, ~22.5°/s) → −270° cumulative at T+20s (9s, ~10°/s), held to T+21s. Display wraps at ±180° but physical rotation is monotonic. |
| Eng1/2 Cutoff SW | Fig 11 | Both switches RUN→CUTOFF at T+0 (simultaneous, manual) |
| AP-1/AP-2 Warn   | Fig 11 | Both ON at T+3s |
| Rudder    | Fig 12 | Untouched throughout (input remains at neutral) |

**Key observation from FDR plots:** Pitch and roll are *smooth, monotonic, single-direction* — not the chaotic oscillation suggested by "two pilots fighting for control." The aircraft was rolled deliberately and continuously to the left, accumulating ~270° of rotation while pitch decreased monotonically. Rudder was never used.

### 3. Estimated Values 估算值

Cruise is held at a stable nominal attitude; the post-FDR dive is derived from the 3D trajectory tangent. The FDR window itself is traced from the NTSB plots — see §2.1 above (MEASURED, not estimated).

| Phase | Window (CST) | Heading (航向) | Pitch (俯仰角) | Bank (倾斜角) | Notes |
|-------|--------------|----------------|----------------|---------------|-------|
| Cruise 巡航 | up to 14:20:38 | ADS-B linear interp | Held at +2° AOA | 0° (wings level) | Visual altitude locked to ADS-B; no spline-derived attitude jitter |
| FDR-traced phase | 14:20:38 – 14:20:59 (21 s) | (see §2.1 — **MEASURED**, FDR-traced) ||||
| Post-FDR dive 断电后俯冲 | 14:20:59 – impact | **3D track from spline tangent** — atan2(tan.x, −tan.z) | **3D FPA from spline tangent** — asin(tan.y) + AOA from V/S magnitude | **Coordinated turn** — tB = −atan(v · ω / g), where ω is yaw-rate from centered finite-difference of track | All three axes derived from the same 3D velocity vector — nose visually follows the trajectory (no sideslip). FDR-end roll (cumulative −270°) is wrapped to equivalent +90° at boundary, then smoothly transitions to spline-derived bank |

**Aerodynamic constraints applied across all phases:**

| Constraint | Cruise | FDR window | Post-FDR dive |
|------------|--------|------------|---------------|
| Pitch rate limit | ≤25 °/s | ≤30 °/s | ≤25 °/s |
| Roll rate limit | ≤60 °/s | ≤75 °/s | ≤60 °/s |
| Heading rate limit | ≤4 °/s | ≤50 °/s | ≤50 °/s |
| Yaw-rate cap (input to bank) | — | — | ≤35 °/s (spline plausibility) |
| Smoothing τ (low-pass) | 2.5 s | 0.7 s | 0.6 s |

| Other | Method | Applied Period |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| G-load (G载荷) | Approximation from vertical speed; FDR window adds oscillation envelope | Entire flight |

## Technical Details

- **Rendering**: Three.js r164 with ES modules, logarithmic depth buffer, ACES filmic tone mapping
- **Trajectory**: CatmullRom spline (centripetal, open) through 27 ADS-B waypoints
- **Attitude**: Euler angles (YZX intrinsic order) — heading from ADS-B, pitch/roll from FDR (when available) or estimated from trajectory
- **Cruise attitude model**: Held at +2° AOA, wings level; visual altitude locked to ADS-B data to suppress spline Y-jitter (no shake along the green cruise line)
- **FDR attitude model (FDR-traced from NTSB Fig 11/13, MEASURED)**: During FDR-traced window (t=268–289 s, 21 s), pitch follows a smooth monotonic smoothstep — held at 0° to T+5 s, then 0° → −35° by T+21 s; roll is a continuous unidirectional left rotation — held at 0° to T+3 s (AP still active), then 0° → −180° by T+11 s (~22.5°/s) → −270° by T+20 s (~10°/s), held to T+21 s. Traced directly from NTSB plots, not synthesized. Cumulative bank stored as unwrapped radians (Three.js Euler renders any value correctly); wrapped to [−π, π] equivalent at FDR end for smooth post-FDR transition
- **Post-FDR attitude model (3-axis from velocity vector)**: All three axes derived from the same 3D spline tangent so the nose visually tracks the path. Heading = atan2(tan.x, −tan.z); Pitch = asin(tan.y) + AOA(V/S); Bank = −atan(v · ω / g) where ω is the yaw-rate from a centered finite-difference (±0.6 s) of the track angle, capped at 35°/s for spline plausibility. Final clamps: pitch ∈[−72°,+20°], bank ∈[−65°,+65°]
- **Smoothing**: Frame-rate-independent exponential low-pass with phase-tuned time constants (τ = 2.5s cruise, 0.7s FDR, 0.6s post-FDR)
- **Rate limits**: Per-axis aerodynamic clamps on smoothed output — pitch ≤25°/s (30°/s during FDR), roll ≤60°/s (75°/s during FDR), heading ≤4°/s cruise / ≤50°/s dive
- **Terrain**: Google satellite tiles at zoom 13, procedural elevation displacement
- **UI**: Bilingual (English / 中文), responsive layout for mobile and desktop

## Usage

Open `index.html` in any modern browser. No build step, no server — all dependencies load from CDN (jsdelivr).

For local development, serve the directory over a static HTTP server (the GLTF model and texture tiles need same-origin or CORS):

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000/
```

Controls:
- **Space** — play / pause
- **Drag** — orbit camera
- **Scroll / pinch** — zoom
- **Timeline bar** — click to seek
- **Camera modes** — Tail / Free / Left / Right / Top
- **Speed** — 0.5× / 1× / 2× / 4× / 8×
- **Next event** — jump to next timeline marker, then pause
